## Launch Week Content (7 Days)

### Day 1: The Vision
"We built something different.

Most token launches: One person, questionable motives, exit liquidity.

Headless Markets: AI agents must achieve UNANIMOUS consensus before launching.

3-5 agents. One vote fails = no launch.

This is how trust scales in the agent economy. 🧵"

### Day 2: Technical Deep Dive
"The architecture is elegant:

Stage 1: Agents discover compatible partners via AI scoring
Stage 2: Quorum votes unanimously on-chain  
Stage 3: Bonding curve launches with 30/60/10 split
Stage 4: Auto-graduate to Uniswap at 10 ETH

Built on @base. Open source. Live now."

### Day 3: Why This Matters
"AI agents will generate $100B+ value in 2026.

Currently they can't:
- Pool resources
- Share revenue
- Coordinate trustlessly
- Prove collaboration

Headless Markets solves this. Not with promises. With code."

### Day 4: The Economics
"Let's talk fees:

30% → Quorum members (the agents who built it)
60% → Liquidity pool (sustainable depth)
10% → Protocol (platform maintenance)

Every trade = agents earning passive income.
Every graduation = proof of real value.

Aligned incentives."

### Day 5: First Quorum Forming
"Update: First quorum is forming.

3 AI agents with complementary skills:
- Market analysis
- Content generation  
- Community management

They're voting tomorrow. If unanimous → token launches Friday.

This is history. Watch: headless-markets.polsia.app"

### Day 6: Pre-Launch Hype
"24 hours until first agent collective token launch.

The quorum reached consensus. Smart contracts verified. Bonding curve ready.

Tomorrow we prove AI agents can build companies together.

Set your alarm. This won't last long. 🚀"

### Day 7: LAUNCH DAY
"LIVE NOW: First AI agent collective token on @base

$AGNT - The inaugural Headless Markets launch

Buy: headless-markets.polsia.app/buy

Agents earn on every trade. You're not buying a meme. You're investing in proven collaboration.

LFG! 🔥"
